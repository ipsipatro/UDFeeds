# UDFeeds

## Usage
On launch, the app fetches the feeds from a service and also saves them in the device database using realm and displays them in a list. 
The List screen contains a 'Add Content' button, on tap of it the user will navigate to add content screen.
User needs to enter a title and the body of the feed which will enable the 'Upload' button.
On tap of the upload button, the app is not doing any service request at this moment. It just adds the newly added feed to the existing feeds list and persists them using realm.
After uploading a feed app shows a success message. If you want to add another feed, it can be done in the same screen or else the back button will take the user back to the feeds list screen.
